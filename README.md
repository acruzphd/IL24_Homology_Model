# IL24_Homology_Model
Report Prepared by YASARA detailing the procedure  used to create the Homology model of Interleukin-24 (IL-24).

First, to view the report, clone the repository (git clone https://github.com/acruzphd/IL24_Homology_Model.git) and then load the Yasara_Report/IL-24/IL-24.html in any web browser.

The PDB file of the model is located in IL-24_Model/IL-24_model1.pdb and can be visualized with any program capable of rendering PDB files. Additionally, you can view the model by loading the IL-24_Model/IL-24_m1.html in any web browser with WebGL capabilities.
